    // TO DO
    // 2fa - https://medium.com/@maulanayusupp/how-to-create-two-factor-authentication-with-laravel-a44e58f69319
    // write a good spec document

    // TESTING

        // new pipedrive user accounts emails - done
        // new pipedrive sale
            // single invoice deal
            // multiple invoice deal
    // send invoices to resellers

    // QUESTIONS
    // what information do you want on the emails?
    // comissions CRUD?
    // admin needs to mark comissions as paid or not
    // do we need to pull across the details from pipedrive like address / phone too? app/Http/Controllers/Admin/Operations/SendXeroInvoiceOperation.php:57
    // send welcome email for resellers?

    // AFTER
    // enable throttle again - app/Http/Kernel.php
    // make it send a nice email with logs
    // do we need a name on the invoice? - how will that be made
    // new type of user called "sales" - must have a monthly target - must be able to see all deals and invoices
    // refactor the models so I can quicky get the information desired
    // use the default values for comission, or the per reseller values - do this later on
    // update the pipedrive deal with the invoice number(s)

    // Automated CRONS
    // function to import products nightly from pipedrive - still works
    // function every minute to check for new logs that are created by pipedrive and have the action deal.updated to remove duplicates as pipedrive is sending duplicated api requests microseconds part -
